# dna Xcode templates
This project contains an Xcode template that creates both a folder and a project structure that I personally feel is more suitable than the default ones Xcode provides. Just download the project and follow the steps below to start using it.

##Step 1.
Add the folder *Custom Templates* into the following path:
```
~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/
```

##Step 2.
Create a new project in Xcode and enjoy the template(s)!
